# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Issue

GitHub Pages was not being updated despite the CI workflow running successfully.
The workflow showed "success" status but the live site was not being deployed.

## Root Cause

The GitHub Pages workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) was missing the
required `environment` configuration that GitHub needs for proper Pages
deployment.

## Solution

Added the missing environment configuration to the GitHub Pages workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ... existing steps ...
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Changes Made

1. Added `environment` configuration with name `github-pages`
2. Added environment URL using deployment output
3. Added `id: deployment` to the Deploy step to capture the output

## Testing

After applying the fix:

1. The workflow will run and properly deploy to GitHub Pages
2. Use `npm run test:pages` to verify the deployment is working
3. The GitHub Pages site should be accessible at:
